CHAPTER II.
THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.

We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, Baker Street,
of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-
rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by
two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did
the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot,
and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from
the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes
and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out
our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to
accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings.

Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and
his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had
invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent
his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally
in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing
could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction
would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room,
hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I
have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected
him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and
cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.
